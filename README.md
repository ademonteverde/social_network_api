# Social Network API

## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. You'll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The API is built using Express.js for routing and utilizes a MongoDB database with the Mongoose ODM. 

## User Story

As a social media startup, I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Featured API routes

- GET routes to return all users and all thoughts

- GET routes to return single user and a single thought

- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts

- POST and DELETE routes for a user's friend list
